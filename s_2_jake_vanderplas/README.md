*Sampling Methods* allow you to use intuitive *computational* approaches in
place of often non-intuitive statistical rules.

If you can write a for-loop, you can do statistical analysis.

Importantly, this is not to say that classical statistics is wrong, or that it
produces bad results. What it says is that, for a lot of people, the
computational approaches will be more intuitive, and will allow you to keep the
question that you're answering in your mind while you're working with the data.

the slide at 31:58 in the talk's video.
