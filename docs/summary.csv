#,technique,example,idea,relevant tool(s),,
1,direct simulation,is a coin fair?,use an available (theoretical) generative model to simulate repetitions of the whole experiment,"np.random.randint(2, size=n_flips)",,
2,shuffling,is group A better than group B?,"lack a generative model so canâ€™t simulate a group member; need a way for the scores to be the simulation themselves

simulate the (sampling) distribution (of possible test scores) by shuffling the labels repeatedly and computing the desired statistic","# in place
random.shuffle(x)

# immutable seq
random.sample(population, k)",,
3,bootstrap resampling (bootstrapping),how can you characterize the distribution of a set of measurements?,"lack a generative model, have a single group

treat the measurements as (a proxy to) its own (sampling) distribution

simulate the (sampling) distribution (of possible measurements) by drawing samples with replacement repeatedly and computing the desired statistic","np.random.randint(n, size=n)",,
,,can be applied to even more complicated statistics,,,,
